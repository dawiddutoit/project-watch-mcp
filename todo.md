## 🔄 Remaining Work

### ✅ COMPLETED: Fix Lucene Index Failure
- [x] **CRITICAL: Fix Lucene index failure by implementing proper text chunking before indexing**
  - Issue: Lucene fulltext index in FAILED state due to 93,571 byte term (exceeds 32,766 limit)
  - Impact: ALL pattern searches completely unusable
  - Solution: Terms must be split to stay under 32,766 bytes before indexing
  - **COMPLETED**: Added `_sanitize_for_lucene()` method that truncates oversized terms
  
- [x] **Index Recovery: Drop and rebuild the current index with proper chunking**
  - Current index is permanently failed and cannot recover
  - Need to drop `code_search` index and recreate with chunking
  - Ensure all documents are properly chunked before indexing
  - **COMPLETED**: Created `scripts/rebuild_lucene_index.py` script for index recovery
  
- [x] **Prevention: Add validation to prevent oversized terms from being indexed**
  - Implement pre-indexing validation to check term sizes
  - Split or truncate terms that exceed byte limit
  - Add error handling to prevent index corruption
  - **COMPLETED**: Sanitization now happens before indexing each chunk

### ✅ COMPLETED: Critical Performance Fix: Background Indexing
- [x] **Implement non-blocking initial indexing** (HIGH PRIORITY)
  - Current issue: MCP server blocks during initial indexing of large repositories
  - Solution: Start MCP server immediately, run indexing in background thread
  - **Direct Solution from Performance Analysis:**
    - Implement **Parallel File Processing with AsyncIO**
    - This directly enables background indexing while server handles requests
    - Combined with batch operations for maximum efficiency
  - Implementation points:
    - Modify `cli.py` to start server before indexing
    - Run initial indexing in background thread/async task
    - Add `get_indexing_status` tool to check progress
    - Allow server to handle requests while indexing
  - Benefits:
    - Immediate server availability
    - No timeout issues for Claude/users
    - Can query already-indexed files while indexing continues
  - Consider adding:
    - Progress indicator in server responses
    - Queue system for indexing requests
    - Graceful handling of queries for not-yet-indexed files

### End-to-End Tests
- Complete workflow with real Neo4j instance
- Multi-project incremental indexing isolation

### Documentation
- [ ] Create incremental indexing strategy document (optional, low priority)

## 🚀 Future Enhancement: File Hash-Based Change Detection

### Current Implementation (Timestamp-Based)
- Uses file modification timestamps to detect changes
- Fast but can miss changes if timestamps are manipulated
- May have false positives with timestamp precision issues

### Proposed Enhancement: Content Hash Verification
Implement a dual-approach system that uses both timestamps and content hashes:

```python
async def detect_changed_files_with_hash(
    self,
    current_files: List[FileInfo],
    indexed_files: Dict[Path, FileMetadata]  # FileMetadata includes timestamp AND hash
) -> Tuple[List[FileInfo], List[FileInfo], List[Path]]:
    """
    Enhanced change detection using timestamps for quick check 
    and content hashes for verification.
    
    Algorithm:
    1. First pass: Check timestamps (fast)
    2. Second pass: For files with same timestamp, compare content hash
    3. Return accurate change detection results
    """
```

### Implementation Steps
1. **Add hash storage to Neo4j schema**:
   - Add `content_hash` property to File nodes
   - Store alongside `last_modified` timestamp

2. **Implement efficient hashing**:
   - Use xxhash or blake3 for speed
   - Cache hashes in memory during session
   - Only compute hash when timestamp changes

3. **Hybrid detection algorithm**:
   - Quick path: If timestamp differs, mark as changed
   - Verification path: If timestamp same, compare hashes
   - Provides both speed and accuracy

### Benefits
- **Accuracy**: Detects content changes even if timestamps unchanged
- **Reliability**: Catches file replacements with same timestamp
- **Performance**: Still fast due to timestamp pre-filtering
- **Integrity**: Can detect file corruption or unexpected changes

### Example Configuration
```python
# Configuration option
[project-watch]
change_detection = "hybrid"  # Options: "timestamp", "hash", "hybrid"
hash_algorithm = "xxhash"    # Options: "xxhash", "blake3", "sha256"

# CLI flag
--change-detection=hybrid
```

### Priority: Medium
This enhancement would improve reliability for edge cases while maintaining performance. Recommended after initial production deployment and user feedback.
