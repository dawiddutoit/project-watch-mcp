# Project: Project Watch MCP - Parallel Execution

## üöÄ Current Focus Areas

### 1. Complexity Analysis Implementation
**Agents**: 
- `python-developer`
- `test-automation-architect`

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Design complexity analysis strategy for multiple languages
- [ ] Implement base complexity analyzers for Python, Java, Kotlin
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite for complexity metrics
- [ ] Add language-specific complexity detection logic
- [ ] Validate analyzer accuracy across different code structures

### 2. Test Coverage Improvements
**Agents**:
- `test-automation-architect`
- `qa-testing-expert`

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Diagnose current coverage measurement timeouts
- [ ] Design enhanced timeout handling for test runs
- [ ] Create comprehensive integration test validation strategy
- [ ] Set up coverage reporting with >80% target
- [ ] Implement automated coverage verification in CI/CD pipeline

### 3. Resource Management Optimization
**Agents**:
- `python-developer`
- `architect`

**Tasks**:
